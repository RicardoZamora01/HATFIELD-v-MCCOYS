Hackathon Finished Project: 1v1 Local Gameplay, using Unity &amp; C#

This is my team's finished Hackathon Project from the theme "Out of Control". It is a 1v1 competitive game where the objective is to burn as much of the enemy's terrain as possible. After 3 minutes, the person who has burnt the most terrain wins. This game was heavily inspired by the Hatfield-McCoy feud. We used a grid-based envorinment with sprite elements to develop the game.
